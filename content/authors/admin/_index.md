Hi! I am a second year PhD student in the Applied Math and Scientific Computation (AMSC) program. I am currently working with Dr. Ramani Duraiswami in the CS department at UMD. I am generally interested in numerical analysis, mathematical modeling and scientific computation for PDEs. I can be reached at mkrishn9[at]umd[dot]edu.
